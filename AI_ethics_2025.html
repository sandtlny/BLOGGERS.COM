    <h1>AI ETHICS 2025</h1>
    <P>AI raises an important concern when it comes to ethics. AI should be well gauged to ensure effective protection from human, data and security at large.
        There should be set constraints of what should AI do and dont's. It is recommended that AI is licensed before use. AI is effective when no loss/damage is on concern.
