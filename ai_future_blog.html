<h1>The future of AI in climate change</h1>
<p>Climate change is becoming a global issue with global warming on it's effect. AI on the rise should help people
    in making the right decisions in their day to day life to protect against such. AI will help the meteorological departments to foresee climate records beforethings get out of hand and we run into extinction.
    It has not yet been established, but a few global companies/industries are working it out to provide an algorithm that suits the 
    global needs using AI to manage climate change. With this technology it will be easy even for pilots and instructors to manage flights without error.
</p>
<p2>Africa on the other hand is notbeing left behind. In some countries like Kenya, students in Universities team up to invent 
    climate change solution based AI applications. A notable example is the ANGA SAFI project from a student in 
Tharaka University. The project aims at giving digital records which are AI based to monitor and raise warnings whenever there are climate changes like increased rainfall patterns.
